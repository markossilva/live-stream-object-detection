# live-stream-object-detection

Share your webcam stream with real-time object detection to the public by Node.js.

## Technologies

This project using the following technologies to go:

- [opencv4nodejs](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/opencv4nodejs): Use it to capture webcam frames and more power
- [TensorFlow Object Detection](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/research/object_detection): Use it to detect objects on a frame
- [FFmpeg](http://ffmpeg.org/): Use it to compress frames and make the live streaming
- [ws](https://github.com/websockets/ws): Use it to send stream to web browser
- [JSMpeg](https://jsmpeg.com/): Use it to decode streaming from server for web browser
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/): Use it to get public and secure URL for exposing the local web server
- [express](https://expressjs.com/): Use it to make a web server
